# js-instrumentation-wasm

This is a WASM-based library for adding Datadog instrumentation to JavaScript and
TypeScript code.

This library isn't intended to be used directly; it powers some of the functionality in
our [build-plugins repo](https://github.com/DataDog/build-plugins). Visit that repo to learn more.
